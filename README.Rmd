## CellSurvAssay

CellSurvAssay consists of a couple of tools that can be used to perform Clonogenic Survival Analysis in R very easily and efficiently. These two tools are:

* CellSurvAssay R package : This helps even beginner R users to perform the analysis in R, while maintaining the flexibility of a package. To know more details about the R package, visit [here](https://pickeringlab.github.io/CellSurvAssay/).

* CellSurvAssay Shiny app : This is a web application that helps users with no experience in R to perform the analysis, in R. The app is based on the CellSurvAssay R package and can be accessed [here](https://pickeringlab.shinyapps.io/CellSurvAssay-App/).

## Purpose of the CellSurvAssay Shiny App

The CellSurvAssay Shiny web app uses the CellSurvAssay R package in the background, which is built around the [CFAssay](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CFAssay.html) R package that can be used to perform Cell Survival Assay analysis in R. However, the CellSurvAssay app has itâ€™s own purposes and advantages:

* it makes performing Clonogenic Survival Analysis in R incredibly user-friendly and efficient, even for users who have no experience in R and don't have the luxury of time to learn it,

* it arranges all the commonly used steps of clonogenic assay analysis in one location and automates the steps very similar to other available automated software,

* it utilizes `ggplot()` to plot the cell suvival curves, and builds better quality figures than other available R packages,

* it is less time consuming and more convenient for the user, as it accepts the raw data for the analysis, and calculates the plating efficiencies by itself,

* it offers various method options for parameter estimation and calculating plating efficiencies, unlike most other available software tools, and

* as R is being utilized, the methodology stays open and the results reproducible.
